# Weather-Network


For this project I created a website that fetches weather with an API using Javascript, HTMl, and Css.

## Description:
 - site returns a 5 day forecast of any city along with current tempurature, humidity, wind speed, and uv index
 - previously searched cities are saved in local storage
